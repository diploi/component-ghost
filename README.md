# Ghost Component for Diploi

Run [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) on Diploi.

Uses the official [ghost](https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost/) Docker image.

## Operation

### Development

When running a development environment, Ghost will be run in development mode too.
This will allow you to develop custom themes and plugins with ease.

To learn more about developing on Ghost, see the [Developing Themes](https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/#developing-themes) section of their docs.

### Production

The production image will be an optimized, minimal version with your custom code baked in.
Depending on which features you have been working on, you might have to apply them in the Ghost Admin panel (like themes and plugins).
